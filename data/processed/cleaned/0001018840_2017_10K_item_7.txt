Net income (loss) attributable to A&F for Fiscal 2016 included certain items related to asset impairment, indemnification recoveries and claims settlement benefits. These items adversely impacted net income (loss) attributable to A&F by $3.7 million and $6.5 million for the second and third quarters of Fiscal 2016, respectively. Net income (loss) attributable to A&F for Fiscal 2015 included certain items related to inventory write-down, asset impairment, legal settlement charges, store fixture disposal, the Company’s profit improvement initiative, lease termination and store closure costs and restructuring. These items adversely impacted net income (loss) attributable to A&F by $26.1 million $9.4 million and $16.0 million for the first, second and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2015, respectively, and increased net income attributable to A&F by $9.0 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. Net income (loss) attributable to A&F for Fiscal 2015 included the correction of certain errors relating to prior periods. The impact of the amounts recorded out-of-period resulted in a decrease in net income attributable to A&F of $2.6 million and $1.9 million for the second and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2015, respectively, and an increase in net income attributable to A&F of $1.2 million for the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. The Company does not believe these corrections were material to any current or prior interim or annual periods that were affected. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Abercrombie Fitch Co. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Abercrombie Fitch Co. and its subsidiaries (the Company) at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Columbus, Ohio ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures A&F maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that A&F files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to A&F’s management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. A&F’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer of A&F and the Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of A&F evaluated the effectiveness of A&F’s design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year ended The Chief Executive Officer of A&F and the Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of A&F concluded that A&F’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of A&F is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. A&F’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of A&F, management evaluated the effectiveness of A&F’s internal control over financial reporting as of using criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on the assessment of A&F’s internal control over financial reporting, under the criteria described in the preceding sentence, management has concluded that, as of A&F’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. A&F’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of A&F’s internal control over financial reporting as of as stated in their report, which is included in “ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” of this Annual Report on Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in A&F’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, A&F’s internal control over financial reporting.
