Approximately 25 percent and 23 percent of our fiscal 2016 purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from Vietnam, China, or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or taxes, or vendors potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars.

We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. Also see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed”, "Risk Factors—If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected", and "Risk Factors—Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events" in Item 1A of this Competitors The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Our business is highly competitive” in Item 1A of this Employees As of we had a workforce of approximately 135,000 employees, which includes a combination of part-time and full-time employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak holiday selling season. To remain competitive in the retail apparel industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, supply chain, marketing, and other functions. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. Also see the section entitled “Risk Factors—The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations” in Item 1A of this Available Information We make available on our website, www.gapinc.com, under “Investors, Financial Information, SEC Filings,” free of charge, our annual reports on quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish them to the SEC.
