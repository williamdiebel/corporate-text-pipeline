Executive Summary Fiscal included the following notable items: GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.58 Adjusted earnings per share were $5.01 Comparable sales decreased 0.5 percent reflecting a 0.8 percent decrease in traffic. Comparable digital channel sales growth of 27 percent contributed 1.0 percentage points of comparable sales growth. We returned $5.0 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Sales were $69,495 million for a decrease of $4,290 million or 5.8 percent from the prior year, primarily due to the Pharmacy Transaction. Earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes in decreased by $561 million or 10.1 percent from to $4,969 million primarily due to the 2015 gain on the Pharmacy Transaction. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,329 million $5,254 million and $5,157 million for and respectively. In 2015, proceeds from the Pharmacy Transaction are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations. Refer to Note of the Financial Statements for additional information about the transaction.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP metric, excludes the impact of certain items not related to our routine retail operations. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is meaningful to provide period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided on page 21. We report after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) from continuing operations because we believe ROIC provides a meaningful measure of our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. For the trailing twelve months ended ROIC was 15.0 percent, compared with 16.0 percent for the trailing twelve months ended Excluding the net gain on the Pharmacy Transaction, ROIC was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2016. A reconciliation of ROIC is provided on page 22. Analysis of Results of Operations Segment Results Percent Change (dollars in millions) 2016/2015 2015/2014 Sales 69,495 73,785 72,618 1.6 Cost of sales 48,872 51,997 51,278 1.4 Gross margin 20,623 21,788 21,340 2.1 SG&A expenses 13,360 14,448 14,503 EBITDA 7,263 7,340 6,837 7.4 Depreciation and amortization 2,298 2,213 2,129 3.8 3.9 EBIT 4,965 5,127 4,708 8.9 Note: See Note of our Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to earnings before income taxes and more information about items recorded outside of segment SG&A. Sales include $3,815 million and $4,148 million related to our former pharmacy and clinic businesses for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and cost of sales include $3,076 million and $3,222 million, respectively. The sale of these businesses had no notable impact on EBITDA or EBIT. For 2016, 2015, and 2014, SG&A includes $663 million, $641 million, and $629 million, respectively, of net profit-sharing income from the arrangement with TD. Rate Analysis Gross margin rate 29.7 29.5 29.4 SG&A expense rate 19.2 19.6 20.0 EBITDA margin rate 10.5 9.9 9.4 Depreciation and amortization expense rate 3.3 3.0 2.9 EBIT margin rate 7.1 6.9 6.5 Note: Rate analysis metrics are computed by dividing the applicable amount by sales. Excluding sales of our former pharmacy and clinic businesses, EBITDA margin rates were 10.5 percent and 10.0 percent for 2015 and 2014, respectively. and EBIT margin rates were 7.3 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. Sales Sales include all merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and gift card breakage. Refer to Note of the Financial Statements for a definition of gift card breakage. Digital channel sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our conventional websites. Digital channel sales may be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or our stores. The decrease in 2016 sales reflects a decrease of approximately $3,815 million due to the Pharmacy Transaction and a comparable sales decrease of 0.5 percent, partially offset by the contribution from new stores. The increase in 2015 sales reflects an increase in comparable sales of 2.1 percent and the contribution from new stores, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $550 million due to the Pharmacy Transaction. Inflation did not materially affect sales in any period presented. Sales by Channel Stores 95.6 96.6 97.4 Digital 4.4 3.4 2.6 Total Excluding sales of our former pharmacy and clinic businesses, stores and digital channels sales were 96.4 percent and 3.6 percent of total sales, respectively, for 2015 and 97.2 and 2.8 percent of total sales, respectively, for 2014. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. We removed pharmacy and clinic sales from the 2015 sales amounts when calculating 2016 comparable sales. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Comparable Sales Comparable sales change 2.1 1.3 Drivers of change in comparable sales: Number of transactions 1.3 Average transaction amount 0.3 0.8 1.5 Contribution to Comparable Sales Change Stores channel comparable sales change 1.3 0.7 Digital channel contribution to comparable sales change 1.0 0.8 0.7 Total comparable sales change 2.1 1.3 Note: Amounts may not foot due to rounding Sales by Product Category Percentage of Sales Household essentials Food, beverage, and pet supplies Apparel and accessories Home furnishings and décor Hardlines Total Includes pharmacy, beauty, personal care, baby care, cleaning, and paper products. Pharmacy represented percent and percent in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Includes dry grocery, dairy, frozen food, beverages, candy, snacks, deli, bakery, meat, produce, and pet supplies. Includes apparel for women, men, boys, girls, toddlers, infants and newborns, as well as intimate apparel, jewelry, accessories, and shoes. Includes furniture, lighting, kitchenware, small appliances, home décor, bed and bath, home improvement, automotive, and seasonal merchandise such as patio furniture and holiday décor. Includes electronics (including video game hardware and software), music, movies, books, computer software, sporting goods, and toys. Further analysis of sales metrics is infeasible due to the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix and transfer of sales to new stores. TD offers credit to qualified guests through Target-branded credit cards: the Target Credit Card and the Target MasterCard Credit Card (Target Credit Cards). Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as REDcards Guests receive a percent discount on virtually all purchases and free shipping at Target.com when they use a REDcard. We monitor the percentage of sales that are paid for using REDcards (REDcard Penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our REDcards are also incremental sales for Target. REDcard Penetration Target Debit Card 12.8 12.1 11.2 Target Credit Cards 11.2 10.1 9.7 Total REDcard Penetration 24.0 22.3 20.9 Note: Excluding pharmacy and clinic sales, total REDcard penetration would have been 23.2 percent and 21.9 percent for 2015 and 2014, respectively. The sum of Target Credit Cards and Target Debit Card penetration may not equal Total REDcard Penetration due to rounding. Gross Margin Rate Our gross margin rate was 29.7 percent in 29.5 percent in and 29.4 percent in The 2016 increase was primarily due to the Pharmacy Transaction and favorable category sales mix, partially offset by increased shipping and digital fulfillment costs. Cost of goods savings helped offset the impact of a competitive promotional environment. The 2015 increase was primarily due to favorable category sales mix and lower promotional activity relative to the highly promotional period in 2014 following the 2013 data breach, partially offset by the impact of increased digital channel sales. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Rate Our SG&A expense rate was 19.2 percent in 19.6 percent in and 20.0 percent in The decrease in primarily resulted from the benefit of the Pharmacy Transaction and technology-related cost savings, partially offset by increased stores hourly payroll. The decrease in 2015 primarily resulted from cost saving initiatives and reduced marketing expense, partially offset by investments in other initiatives, none of which were individually significant. Store Data Change in Number of Stores Beginning store count 1,792 1,790 Opened Closed (13 Ending store count 1,802 1,792 Number of Stores and Retail Square Feet Number of Stores Retail Square Feet 170,000 or more sq. ft. 49,328 49,688 50,000 to 169,999 sq. ft. 1,504 1,505 189,620 189,677 49,999 or less sq. ft.

Other Performance Factors Other Selling, General and Administrative Expenses We recorded $(4) million, $216 million, and $174 million of selling, general and administrative expenses outside of the segment during and respectively, because they relate to discretely managed matters. Additional information about these discretely managed items is provided within Note 30 of the Financial Statements. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense from continuing operations was $1,004 million $607 million and $882 million for and respectively. Net interest expense for 2016 and 2014 included a loss on early retirement of debt of $422 million and $285 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes Our 2016 effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to 32.7 percent, from 32.5 percent in driven primarily by the 2015 rate impact of the $112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss. This comparative rate impact was partially offset by $27 million of excess tax benefit in 2016 related to shared-based payments after the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and lower pretax earnings. Note of the Financial Statements provides a tax rate reconciliation. Our 2015 effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to 32.5 percent, from 33.0 percent in driven primarily by the $112 million tax benefit from releasing the valuation allowance on a capital loss. This benefit was partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in the favorable resolution of various income tax matters and the rate impact of higher pretax earnings. The resolution of various income tax matters reduced tax expense by $8 million and $35 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Discontinued Operations See Note of the Financial Statements for information about our Canada exit. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Measures To provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (Adjusted EPS). This metric excludes certain items presented below. We believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EPS differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

The 2014 amounts include impairments of $16 million related to undeveloped land in the U.S. and $13 million of expense related to converting co-branded card program to MasterCard. We have also disclosed after-tax return on invested capital for continuing operations (ROIC), which is a ratio based on GAAP information, with the exception of adjustments made to capitalize operating leases. Operating leases are capitalized as part of the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors. We believe this metric provides a meaningful measure of the effectiveness of our capital allocation over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.

See the following Reconciliation of Capitalized Operating Leases table for the adjustments to our GAAP total rent expense to obtain the hypothetical capitalization of operating leases and related operating lease interest. Calculated using the effective tax rate for continuing operations, which was 32.7 percent and 32.5 percent for the trailing twelve months ended and For the twelve months ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, includes tax effect of $1,624 million and $1,799 million, respectively, related to EBIT and $23 million and $28 million, respectively, related to operating lease interest. Calculated as eight times our trailing twelve months rent expense. Average based on the invested capital at the end of the current period and the invested capital at the end of the prior period. Excluding the net gain on the Pharmacy Transaction, ROIC was 13.9 percent for the trailing twelve months ended January 30, 2016. Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is total rent expense. Capitalized operating lease obligations and operating lease interest should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Due to the timing of the sale late in 2015, we did not fully deploy the net proceeds by the end of 2015. Short-term investments of $1,110 million and $3,008 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at the end of and respectively. Our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. This policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. We also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments. Capital Allocation We follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals. Cash Flows Our operations were funded by internally and externally generated funds. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $5,329 million in compared with $5,254 million in These cash flows, combined with period year-end cash position, allowed us to invest in the business, fund early debt retirement and maturities, pay dividends, and repurchase shares under our share repurchase program. Proceeds from the Pharmacy Transaction are included in investing cash flows provided by continuing operations during 2015. Inventory Year-end inventory was $8,309 million compared with $8,601 million in The decrease was due to our alignment of inventory levels with the slowing sales trend while appropriately supporting instocks. Share Repurchases During 2016, 2015, and 2014 we returned $3,686 million $3,441 million and $41 million respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item of this Annual Report on and Note to the Financial Statements for more information. Dividends We paid dividends totaling $1,348 million ($2.32 per share) in and $1,362 million ($2.16 per share) in a per share increase of 7.4 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1,359 million ($2.36 per share) in a per share increase of 7.3 percent over We declared dividends totaling $1,378 million $2.20 per share) in a per share increase of 10.6 percent over We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering, and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future. Short-term and Long-term Financing Our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. Within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. Our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. As of our credit ratings were as follows: Credit Ratings Moody's Standard and Poor's Fitch Long-term debt A2 A Commercial paper P-1 A-1 F2 If our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. In we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper. In 2015, we funded our peak holiday sales period working capital needs through internally generated funds. Commercial Paper (dollars in millions) Maximum daily amount outstanding during the year Average amount outstanding during the year Amount outstanding at year-end Weighted average interest rate 0.43 0.11 We have additional liquidity through a committed $2.5 billion revolving credit facility obtained through a group of banks in October 2016 which expires in October 2021. This new unsecured revolving credit facility replaced a $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2018. No balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during or 2014. Most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. In addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. We are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, at no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to maintain operations, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future. We continue to anticipate ample access to commercial paper and long-term financing. Capital Expenditures (a) In addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2016, 2015, and 2014 with total future minimum lease payments of $550 million, $338 million, and $85 million, respectively. Capital expenditures increased in 2016 from the prior year because we increased our investments in existing stores, including remodels and guest experience enhancements. These increases were partially offset by continued efficiency gains in technology. Capital expenditures decreased in 2015 from the prior year as we opened fewer large-format stores and realized efficiency gains in technology, partially offset by increased guest experience and supply chain investments. As noted in the footnote to the chart presented above, we substantially increased our investments in leases in 2016 and 2015. We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to increase to approximately $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion as we accelerate the rate of store remodels and flexible-format store openings, and continue to make supply chain investments. We also expect our rate of investment in store leases to continue to increase. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations as of Payments Due by Period Less than 1-3 3-5 After (millions) Total Year Years Years Years Recorded contractual obligations: Long-term debt 11,814 1,683 1,203 2,150 6,778 Capital lease obligations 1,963 1,529 Deferred compensation Real estate liabilities Tax contingencies Unrecorded contractual obligations: Interest payments long-term debt 6,308 4,269 Operating leases 3,876 2,916 Purchase obligations 1,762 Real estate obligations Future contributions to retirement plans Contractual obligations 26,506 3,375 3,553 3,630 15,948 Represents principal payments only. See Note of the Financial Statements for further information. These payments also include $348 million and $269 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for stores that are expected to open in or later for capital and operating leases, respectively. See Note of the Financial Statements for further information. The timing of deferred compensation payouts is estimated based on payments currently made to former employees and retirees, forecasted investment returns, and the projected timing of future retirements. Real estate liabilities include costs incurred but not paid related to the construction or remodeling of real estate and facilities. Estimated tax contingencies of $222 million, including interest and penalties and primarily related to continuing operations, are not included in the table above because we are not able to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. See Note of the Financial Statements for further information. Purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm minimum commitments for inventory purchases, merchandise royalties, equipment purchases, marketing-related contracts, software acquisition/license commitments, and service contracts. We issue inventory purchase orders in the normal course of business, which represent authorizations to purchase that are cancelable by their terms. We do not consider purchase orders to be firm inventory commitments; therefore, they are excluded from the table above. If we choose to cancel a purchase order, we may be obligated to reimburse the vendor for unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. We also issue trade letters of credit in the ordinary course of business, which are excluded from this table as these obligations are conditioned on terms of the letter of credit being met. Real estate obligations include commitments for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of real estate and facilities. We have not included obligations under our pension plans in the contractual obligations table above because no additional amounts are required to be funded as of Our historical practice regarding these plans has been to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements, plus periodic discretionary amounts determined to be appropriate. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than the unrecorded contractual obligations noted above, we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. In the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. The following items require significant estimation or judgment: Inventory and cost of sales: Our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. Inventory was $8,309 million and $8,601 million at and respectively, and is further described in Note of the Financial Statements. Vendor income: We receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales. We establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. Based on the agreements in place, this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $385 million and $384 million at January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note of the Financial Statements. Long-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or disposition of the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent opinions of value, as appropriate. We recorded impairments of $43 million $54 million and $124 million in and respectively, which are described further in Note of the Financial Statements. Insurance/self-insurance: and respectively. We believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a five percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would impact our self-insurance expense by $22 million in Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters. Income taxes: and respectively, and primarily relate to continuing operations. We believe the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes are described further in Note of the Financial Statements. Pension accounting: We maintain a funded qualified, defined benefit pension plan, as well as several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plans for certain current and retired team members. The costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Eligibility and the level of benefits varies depending on team members' full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, and/or length of service. The benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, and compensation growth rates. The assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.8 percent is determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. A one percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $37 million. The discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. Our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. A 0.5 percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $30 million. Based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members. Pension benefits are further described in Note of the Financial Statements. Legal and other contingencies: New Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note and Note 22 of the Financial Statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements related to revenues and leases, respectively. We do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements. Forward-Looking Statements This report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. These statements are typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or words of similar import. The principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the expected impact of the Pharmacy Transaction on our financial performance, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the impact of changes in the expected effective income tax rate on net income, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected returns on pension plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation, including those related to the 2013 data breach, expected changes to our contractual obligations and liabilities, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the process, timing and effects of discontinuing our Canadian operations, the resolution of tax matters, changes in our assumptions and expectations, and the expected benefits of restructuring activities. All such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
